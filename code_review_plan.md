### 3.2. Startup and Configuration Files

#### 3.2.1. `Program.cs`

**Focus Areas:**

- **Namespace Usings:** Verify namespaces are correctly used and aligned with .NET 9.0 conventions.
- **WebApplication Builder:** Review the `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` setup for any deprecated configurations or potential improvements with .NET 9.0.
- **Service Registration (Dependency Injection):**
    - Examine service registrations (`builder.Services.AddScoped`, etc.) for best practices in .NET 9.0.
    - Check for any services that might be registered as singletons but should be scoped or transient in .NET 9.0.
    - Review configuration registrations (`builder.Services.Configure<DatabaseSettings>`) for correct section binding.
- **Middleware Pipeline:**
    - Analyze the middleware pipeline (`app.UseMiddleware<...>`) for order and necessity.
    - Ensure custom middleware (`ApiKeyMiddleware`, `FeatureHeaderMiddleware`, `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware`, `MetricsMiddleware`, `CacheControlMiddleware`) are compatible with .NET 9.0 request pipeline changes.
    - Verify global error handling (`app.Use(async (context, next) => { ... })`) is still the best approach in .NET 9.0 or if newer error handling mechanisms should be considered.
- **Endpoint Mapping:** Review `app.MapControllers()` and `app.MapGet("/metrics", ...)` for API endpoint configurations and ensure they align with .NET 9.0 routing best practices.
- **Serilog Configuration:** Check Serilog configuration for compatibility with .NET 9.0 logging infrastructure and explore potential improvements in logging setup.

#### 3.2.2. `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`

**Focus Areas:**

- **Configuration Sections:** Review all configuration sections (`Logging`, `DatabaseSettings`, `Security`, `FinnoneService`, `Metrics`, `Caching`) for relevance and correctness.
- **Connection Strings:** Verify database connection strings in both `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` are correctly configured for the target database environment.
- **Security Settings:** Review `Security` settings, especially `JwtSettings` and `ApiKey`, for best practices in .NET 9.0 and ensure secrets management is appropriate (consider using User Secrets or Azure Key Vault for production secrets).
- **External Service Configurations:** Check `FinnoneService` configurations (`BaseUrl`, `Timeout`, `RetryCount`) and ensure they are still valid and optimized for .NET 9.0 network handling.
- **Feature Flags/Settings:** Review other settings like `Metrics.Enabled`, `Caching`, `DetailedErrors` and ensure they are correctly used and configured for different environments.

### 3.3. Controllers (`Controllers/`)

- **Controller Base Class:** Ensure controllers inherit from `ControllerBase` or `Controller` appropriately.
- **Action Results:** Verify action results (`IActionResult`, `ActionResult<T>`) are used correctly and efficiently in .NET 9.0.
- **Input Validation:** Check for input validation using data annotations (`[Required]`, `[FromBody]`, `[FromQuery]`) and consider using FluentValidation for more complex validation logic in .NET 9.0.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure all controller actions are asynchronous (`async Task<IActionResult>`) for performance and scalability.
- **API Versioning:** If API versioning is implemented, verify it is compatible with .NET 9.0 and consider using updated API versioning libraries.
- **Error Handling:** Review controller-level error handling and ensure it is consistent with the global exception handling middleware.

### 3.4. Models (`Models/`)

**Focus Areas:**

- **Data Model Structures:** Review data models for correctness and efficiency.
- **Data Annotations:** Check data annotations for validation and data serialization purposes.
- **Relationships:** If Entity Framework Core is used (though not explicitly mentioned, `Data` and `Migrations` folders suggest it), review entity relationships and configurations.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Ensure DTOs are used appropriately for API requests and responses to avoid over-posting and improve performance.
- **Serialization Attributes:** Review serialization attributes (`[JsonProperty]`, etc.) if custom serialization is used.

### 3.5. Services (`Services/`) and Services Interfaces (`Services/Interfaces/`)

**Focus Areas:**

- **Service Logic:** Review business logic within services for correctness and efficiency.
- **Interface Segregation:** Ensure services implement interfaces for better testability and maintainability.
