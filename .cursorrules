- **Cross-Platform Consistency**  
  Verify every feature on both Android and iOS.  
  Ensure parity in functionality and user experience.

- **Code Modification Practices**  
  Focus edits only on parts relevant to the issue.  
  Preserve all unrelated sections untouched.
  when running commands, use powershell when possible as I'm using windows only.
  when running multiple commands, don't use "&&", use ";" only when necessary.

- **Response Protocol**  
  Start replies with a robot emoji (ðŸ¤–).  
  Demonstrate you followed these guidelines.
